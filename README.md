# Connectify-
##About
This app helps connect Creators, Businness and prospective investors. In this day and age driven by the creator economy, our app helps bridge this gap between them.
##Features
The app allows creators to post their calls for any requirements they have- ranging from seeking services from businesses that help improve their content online to a feature where they can recive collaboration requests from the fellow creators. 
From the point of view of a business, they would have the ability for posting announcements regarding influencer marketing requests that would be visible to all the creators on the platform. 
##What problem does our app solve?
Once the app is implemented on a larger scale, it would help reduce the requirement of various channels for communication, reducing the noise and mess around in Social media sites, and helping the connectors to improve their reach with razor sharp focus.
##The Tech that we used the develop the app
For this app, we used Flutter as the development platform, with Firebase for our database and we authenticated our user sign in using the *Sawo API*. For UI design, we worked on Figma. 
##Problems we faced
The bulky and long drawn coding proccess of Authentication was reduced by introducing the Sawo API.
